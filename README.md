## Day 1
### Word pattern
This is a program that compares two strings. The function takes in a pattern and a strings of words. The string is then compared to see if it follows the pattern of the first string.
#### Example: 
the program returns true for: "abba" and "cat dog dog cat". This is because "cat dog dog cat" follows the pattern "abba".
