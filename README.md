# 365-Days-of-Code-23
Coding every single day in 2023 by solving problems on LEETCODE

## Day 1
### Word pattern
This is a program that compares two strings. The function takes in a pattern and a strings of words. The string is then compared to see if it follows the pattern of the first string.
#### Example: 
the program returns True for: "abba" and "cat dog dog cat". This is because "cat dog dog cat" follows the pattern "abba".


## Day 2
### Palindrome Number
This program takes in an integer value and returns a boolean value indicating whether the integer value is a palindrome.
#### Examples:
the program returns True for: 121 because it is a palindrome, i.e. when read from behind, it remains unchanged.
the program returns False for: 133 because it is not a palindrome, i.e. when read from behind, it reads 331 which is not equal to the value 133.
